# পুজোর ঝুলি: image prompts (stickers + moodboards)

For Antigravity (or any image model). Follow the steps exactly. The site turns the images into stickers and templates automatically, but only if these rules are kept.

---

## Part 1: Sticker sheets

**Style references** (attach one to every generation, never copy them):

- `moodboard/references/stickers-style-01.jpg` for **Style A**: illustrated die-cut stickers.
- `moodboard/references/stickers-style-02.jpg` for **Style B**: painted collage cut-outs.

### Steps

1. Build each prompt as **STYLE (A or B) + SHEET RULES + that sheet's 9 subjects**, in the order given. Style C sheets use **STYLE C + SHEET RULES C + 6 subjects**.
2. Generate it square, at the highest resolution available (2048x2048 if possible).
3. Reject the image and regenerate if any of these is true:
   - the count is not exactly 9 (6 for Style C)
   - two stickers touch or overlap
   - the background is not flat green
   - there is a watermark
   - any text is misspelled
4. Save it as `moodboard/stickers/<sheet id>.png`.
5. Add the sheet to `moodboard/stickers.json`. The `names` list is in reading order: left to right, top row first. Example:
   ```json
   { "s01-pujor-jinish": { "group": "পুজোর জিনিস", "names": ["শাঁখ", "ঘণ্টা", "পঞ্চপ্রদীপ", "ধুনুচি", "কোশাকুশি", "মঙ্গলঘট", "চামর", "সিঁদুর কৌটো", "প্রদীপের থালা"] } }
   ```
6. Run `npm run stickers`.
   - Open `moodboard/debug/stickers__<sheet id>.png`: you should see 9 magenta boxes (6 for Style C) with one sticker in each.
   - If two stickers were merged into one box, or one sticker was split across two, regenerate the sheet with more space between the stickers.
7. Run `npm run build`, then commit.

### STYLE A (illustrated die-cut, like stickers-style-01)

> A sheet of hand-illustrated Bengali Durga Puja stickers, warm gouache and watercolour look with soft shading and fine ink outlines, rich deep red, cream, antique gold, leaf green and marigold orange, each sticker with a thick clean cream-white die-cut border and a thin darker outline around that border, premium printed-sticker quality.

### STYLE B (collage cut-outs, like stickers-style-02)

> A sheet of painted collage cut-out elements for a Bengali Durga Puja scrapbook, realistic painted look with soft light, each element cleanly cut out along its own shape with a very thin white edge, no thick border.

### SHEET RULES (end of every sticker prompt)

> Exactly 9 separate stickers arranged in a loose 3 x 3 grid, each one complete and fully inside the image, with wide empty space between them (at least one tenth of the image width), no sticker touching or overlapping another. Background: perfectly flat solid pure green #00FF00 everywhere around and between the stickers, no gradient, no texture, no shadow on the background. No watermark, logo or signature. No text unless a sticker below asks for it; any text spelled exactly as given.

### STYLE C (ornate folk-art, like the first 8 stickers)

Style references: attach `public/stickers/shankh.webp`, `radio.webp`, `durga_eyes.webp` and `prodip.webp` (the first stickers Antigravity made). Use them for the look only; never copy them. Style C sheets have **6 stickers**, not 9, so each one keeps that much detail.

> A sheet of ornate Bengali Durga Puja stickers in a rich folk-art style inspired by Bengal patachitra and Kalighat painting: highly detailed hand-painted illustration with intricate decorative patterns painted on every surface (alpona dots, paisley, lotus petals, tiny floral borders, small trident and third-eye motifs), vivid vermilion red, deep maroon, turquoise, mustard yellow and antique gold with fine gold linework, cream highlights, soft painterly shading and a gentle glossy shine. Small accent elements (tiny flowers, leaves, curls of smoke, a little alpona base) may sit close around the main object but stay inside the same sticker outline. Every sticker has one thick, clean pure-white die-cut border following its whole silhouette, with a very thin soft grey line around that border. Premium glossy vinyl sticker quality, front-facing, each sticker large and centred in its own space.

### SHEET RULES C (end of every Style C prompt)

> Exactly 6 separate stickers in a 3 x 2 grid (3 across, 2 down), each one complete and fully inside the image, with wide empty space between them and around the edges (at least one tenth of the image width), no sticker touching or overlapping another. Background: perfectly flat solid pure green #00FF00 everywhere around and between the stickers, no gradient, no texture, no shadow on the background. Do not use bright green inside the stickers; leaves and other green parts are deep olive or dark green. No watermark, logo or signature. No text anywhere unless a sticker below asks for it.

### Sheets 13-18 (Style C, 36 stickers)

## Part 2: Moodboard templates

**Style references:** `moodboard/references/style-01.webp` to `style-08.webp` (and the 8 live templates in `moodboard/originals/`).

- Attach 02, 03 or 04 for the light designs.
- Attach 08 for the dark designs.

### Steps

1. Build each prompt as **BASE + the design text + FRAME RULES**, with that design's photo count and window colour filled in.
2. Generate in vertical **9:16** at the highest resolution. Make 3 variations and keep the best one.
3. Reject the image and regenerate if any of these is true:
   - the number of empty frames is wrong
   - anything sits inside a frame (words like "ছবি বসাও", a flower, an icon)
   - a frame's inside is not one flat colour
   - any Bangla text is misspelled
   - there is a watermark
4. Save it as `moodboard/originals/<id>__story.png`.
   - Optional: the same design recomposed in 4:5, saved as `<id>__post.png`.
5. Add it to `moodboard/templates.json`, for example: `"kumartuli": { "name": "কুমোরটুলি", "photos": 1 }`.
6. Run `npm run templates`.
   - It must print `ok <id>__story: N/N windows`.
   - Open `moodboard/debug/<id>__story.png`: every frame should be pink with a red box, and nothing else should be pink.
   - If a paper rim is left inside a frame, add `"tune": { "colour": 44, "reach": 14, "grow": 3 }` to that entry and run it again.
7. Add `"<id>__story"` to `VERIFIED` in `src/editor/templates.ts`. Then run `npm run build` and commit.

### BASE (start of every moodboard prompt)

> Vertical 9:16 phone-story moodboard, ultra detailed, high resolution. A handmade scrapbook collage about Bengali Durga Puja in Kolkata: layered torn paper, aged vintage photo paper, washi tape, brass paper clips, wooden pegs, lace doilies, die-cut paper stickers with white borders, real props photographed from above, Bengali red-and-white laal paar saree textures, warm golden festive light, deep reds, cream, turmeric yellow and antique gold, soft realistic shadows. Nostalgic and emotional, the feeling of "pujo mane bari phera" (Pujo means coming home). Same visual quality and richness as the attached reference image, but a completely new composition.

### FRAME RULES (end of every moodboard prompt; fill in N and COLOUR)

> The collage contains EXACTLY N empty photo frames for the viewer's own photos. The inside of every frame is one perfectly flat, solid, plain COLOUR: completely blank, with no texture, no stain, no gradient, no shadow, no text, no icon and no object inside. Decorations may touch a frame's border or overlap one small corner, but never the inside. Every frame is large (at least a third of the image width), roughly rectangular, upright or tilted no more than 10 degrees, and no two frames overlap. No watermark, logo, signature, app interface or brand name. Bengali text only where this prompt gives it, spelled exactly as given; no other text anywhere.

COLOUR = `warm beige #E6DCC8` for light designs, `matte black #121212` for night designs.

### Designs 1-15
